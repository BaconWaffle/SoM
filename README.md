# Set-of-Mark Prompting -- Let's use Visual Prompting for Vision!

:grapes: \[[Read our arXiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11441.pdf)\] &nbsp; :apple: \[[Project Page](https://som-gpt4v.github.io/)\] 

:fire: We present **S**et-**o**f-**M**ark (SoM) prompting, simply overlaying a number of spatial and speakable marks on the images, to unleash the visual grounding abilities of large multimodal models (LMMs), such as GPT-4V.

### ðŸ”¥ News

* [10/18] We are going to release the SoM toolbox very soon. Stay tunned!

Users can select which granularity of masks to generate, and which mode to use between automatic (top) and interactive (bottom). A higher alpha blending value (0.4) is used for better visualization.
### :unicorn: Interleaved Prompt
SoM enables interleaved prompts which include textual and visual content. The visual content can be represented using the region indices.

## Use case
### :tulip: Grounded Reasoning and Cross-Image Reference

<img width="972" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-18 at 10 10 41" src="https://github.com/microsoft/SoM/assets/34880758/033cd16c-876c-4c03-961e-590a4189bc9e">

In comparison to GPT-4V without SoM, adding marks enables GPT-4V to ground the
reasoning on detailed contents of the image (Left). Clear object cross-image references are observed
on the right.

Case study on solving CAPTCHA. GPT-4V gives the wrong answer with a wrong number
of squares while finding the correct squares with corresponding marks after SoM prompting.
### :mountain_snow: Knowledge Sharing
<img width="733" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-18 at 10 18 44" src="https://github.com/microsoft/SoM/assets/34880758/dc753c3f-ada8-47a4-83f1-1576bcfb146a">

Case study on an image of dish for GPT-4V. GPT-4V does not produce a grounded answer
with the original image. Based on SoM prompting, GPT-4V not only speaks out the ingredients but
also corresponds them to the regions.
### :mosque: Personalized Suggestion

SoM-pormpted GPT-4V gives very precise suggestions while the original one fails, even
with hallucinated foods, e.g., soft drinks
### :blossom: Tool Usage Instruction
<img width="734" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-18 at 10 19 39" src="https://github.com/microsoft/SoM/assets/34880758/9b35b143-96af-41bd-ad83-9c1f1e0f322f">
Likewise, GPT4-V with SoM can help to provide thorough tool usage instruction
, teaching
users the function of each button on a controller. Note that this image is not fully labeled, while
GPT-4V can also provide information about the non-labeled buttons.

GPT-4V with SoM gives a reasonable suggestion on how to achieve a goal in a gaming
scenario.

### :deciduous_tree: Results
We conduct experiments on various vision tasks to verify the effectiveness of our SoM. Results show that GPT4V+SoM outperforms specialists on most vision tasks and is comparable to MaskDINO on COCO panoptic segmentation.
